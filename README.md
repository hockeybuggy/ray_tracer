# Ray Tracer

[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/hockeybuggy/ray-tracer.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/hockeybuggy/ray-tracer)

This repository is just me working through the exercises in ["The Ray Tracer
Challenge" by Jamis Buck](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge).

Quite a bit of it is just me trying to get better at Rust.
